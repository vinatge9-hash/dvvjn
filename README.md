# Aurora Coffee Collective - Ultra-Modern Coffee Website

This project generates a modern, glassmorphism coffee shop website with:

- Tailwind CSS via CDN (no build step required) for rapid styling.
- Glassmorphism UI on navigation, cards, and buttons.
- Particle background and a custom cursor for a tactile feel.
- Magnetic button effects, ripple interactions, and 3D card tilt.
- Dark/light mode toggle with smooth transitions.
- Rich text animations (word reveal, typewriter, gradient text, split hover).
- Scroll-triggered reveals and a loading screen on index.
- Fully JS-driven animations (no CSS-only animations).

How to use:

1) Open index.html â€“ this is the landing page with a loading screen, hero, and feature sections.
2) Explore menu.html for a full coffee menu.
3) Read about the story on about.html.
4) Contact via contact.html.

The code is modular and designed to be extended with additional pages or content.
